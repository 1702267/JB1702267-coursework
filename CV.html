				<!--INTERESTS CARD-->
				<article class="col-md-3">
				<div class="card bg-light mb-3">
				<div class="card-body">
					<h4>Interests</h4>
					<p>Outside of school and work, I used to partake in horse riding once a week. This helped to improve my confidence and team working skills as well as my interactions with both people and animals. Sadly I had to stop this so that I can focus on university, but continue to retain and expand on all that I have learned from it. I am also a fan of science fiction and books/comic books and spend a lot of time reading and furthering my knowledge and vocabulary. I also have a high interest in computers, as I find the way they work and the tasks they can do to be very fascinating. I also enjoy drawing, which helps to improve my creativity and my hand-eye coordination, as well as furthering my creative skills (check out the <a href="hobbies.html">Hobbies and Interests</a> page to find out more about how I like to spend my time.)</p>
